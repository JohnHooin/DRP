                    <p>Lemon pepper just so happens to be my favorite flavor of chicken wings. Wings, however, are not a favorite weeknight dinner. Laboring over a hot pot of oil and dealing with batches of wings is nowhere on my weekday to-do list. Plump, juicy chicken breasts pan-fried and smothered in a lemon pepper sauce, though? Yeah, that’s more my weeknight style. 

                        Lemon pepper seasoning along with fresh lemon juice give the chicken and luscious sauce tons of flavor without a lot of effort. All you need is 15 minutes of cook time and even less prep time to have this entrée ready for tonight’s dinner. Serve with a garden salad and a starch like steamed white rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce and dinner’s complete.</p>
